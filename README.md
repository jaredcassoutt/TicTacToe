# TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game made with Python that can be played in a terminal. It displays a board with numbers in every spot, and as the player selects a spot, an 'X' fills the position. A computer player is also available in the game and simply chooses a random spot from the available board positions.
